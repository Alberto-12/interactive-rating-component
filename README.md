## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

 This is a small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM with JavaScript but  is missing the Javasript code which I still need to work on. It was usefull anyway to learn CSS positioning using Flexbox. Here's a snippet of the CSS code with Flexbox and hovering effect:

```css
.buttonContainer {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  width: 281px;
  height: 42px;
  margin-left: 24px;
}

.button:hover {
  background:#fc7614;
  transition: 0.7s;
  color: white;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learn more about css positioning techniques like grid and also to implement the Javascript code. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand better how Flexbox works.
