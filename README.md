## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use HTML and CSS. 

it was really interesting to lear about display: flex rule and hovering effect:

```css
.buttonContainer {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  width: 281px;
  height: 42px;
  margin-left: 24px;
}

.button:hover {
  background:#fc7614;
  transition: 0.7s;
  color: white;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learn more about css positioning techniques like grid. 

### Useful resources
